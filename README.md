# Pokemon Top Trumps Game

This is my final project for the Code First Girls Intro to Python & apps course.  I collaborated with my teammate Awa Danfa, to design and build a Pokemon themed game based on the populare Top Trumps card game.

## Must Have Tasks:
- [x] Generated a random number between 1 and 151 to use as the Pokémon ID number
- [x] Used the Pokémon API get a Pokémon based on its ID number
- [x] Created a dictionary that contains the returned Pokémon's name, id, height and weight
- [x] Got a random Pokémon for the player and another for their opponent
- [x] Asked the user which stat they want to use (id, height or weight)
- [x] Compared the player's and opponent's Pokémon on the chosen stat to decide who wins

## Should Have Tasks:
- [x] Asked the user for their username
- [x] Used a different stat for the Pokémon from the API (number of moves)
- [x] Got 3 random Pokémon and asked the player to select which one they want to use
- [x] Asked the player to select how many rounds they want to play
- [x] Played the number of rounds asked for; the player with the most rounds won, wins the game
- [x] Recorded the match and round results in a csv
- [x] Allowed the player and their opponent to take turns choosing the stat
- [x] Handled user input error with appropriate error messages
- [x] Printed user's player stats from the csv, at the end of the match (total matches played / total matches won / match win rate / highest score)
- [x] Used newlines to make the printed output more user-friendly and more like reading a Top Trump card

## Could Have Tasks:
- [] Research Python user interfaces
- [] Create user interface for game

## What we enjoyed:
- Problem solving!
- Using different online tools (PyCharm code with me / Codeshare)
- Using some APIs
- Creating a CSV file to store and print the results
- Being able to develop a real game application
- Extending the game with our own ideas, and having unlimited options to do so
- Using loops and conditionals to control flow
- Working as a team

## Where we struggled:
- Scope of variables
- Frustration with indentation
- Not being able to create a visually appealing game
- Trying to think what the user might do wrong and give appropriate error messages
- Didn't have time to use a different API

## What we learnt:
- Try and except statements
- Structuring code with functions at the top
- Understanding indentation, conditional statements and loops much better
- Importance of producing clean and commented code so that your coworker can understand it
- Importance of logical thinking and going step by step
- There is always a solution; break the problem down and then Google it!
