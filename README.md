# Pokemon Top Trumps Game

This is my final project for the Code First Girls Intro to Python & apps course.  I collaborated with my teammate, to design and build a Pokemon themed game based on the popular Top Trumps card game.

## PROJECT REQUIREMENTS

### Must Have Tasks:
- [x] Generate a random number between 1 and 151 to use as the Pokémon ID number
- [x] Use the Pokémon API get a Pokémon based on its ID number
- [x] Create a dictionary that contains the returned Pokémon's name, id, height and weight
- [x] Get a random Pokémon for the player and another for their opponent
- [x] Ask the user which stat they want to use (id, height or weight)
- [x] Compare the player's and opponent's Pokémon on the chosen stat to decide who wins

### Should Have Tasks:
- [x] Ask the user for their username
- [x] Use a different stat for the Pokémon from the API (number of moves)
- [x] Get 3 random Pokémon and ask the player to select which one they want to use
- [x] Ask the player to select how many rounds they want to play
- [x] Play the number of rounds asked for; the player with the most rounds won, wins the game
- [x] Record the match and round results in a csv
- [x] Allow the player and their opponent to take turns choosing the stat
- [x] Handle user input error with appropriate error messages
- [x] Print user's player stats, from the csv, at the end of the match (total matches played / total matches won / match win rate / highest score)
- [x] Use newlines to make the printed output more user-friendly and more like reading a Top Trump card

### Could Have Tasks:
- [x] Research Python user interfaces
- [ ] Create user interface for game
- [ ] Scoreboard system
- [ ] Use a different API

## PROJECT SCREENSHOTS

## PROJECT EVALUATION

### What we enjoyed:
- Problem solving!
- Using different online tools (PyCharm code with me / Codeshare)
- Using some APIs
- Creating a CSV file to store and print the results
- Being able to develop a real game application
- Extending the game with our own ideas, and having unlimited options to do so
- Using loops and conditionals to control flow
- Working as a team

### Where we struggled:
- Scope of variables
- Frustration with indentation
- Not being able to create a visually appealing game
- Trying to think what the user might do wrong and give appropriate error messages
- Didn't have time to use a different API

### What we learnt:
- Try and except statements
- Structuring code with functions at the top
- Understanding indentation, conditional statements and loops much better
- Importance of producing clean and commented code so that your coworker can understand it
- Importance of logical thinking and going step by step
- There is always a solution; break the problem down and then Google it!

## COURSE COMPLETION AWARD

I was very pleased to win **first place** in the final project competition and was awarded a **Highly Commended** certificate!
